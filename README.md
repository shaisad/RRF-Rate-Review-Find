## Overview:
RRF is a PHP-based website centered around Gazipur, designed for reviewing food items and restaurants. It is built to assist users in finding high-quality food items at their preferred restaurants by showcasing a diverse selection of menu offerings and restaurant options, complete with ratings and reviews.

## Key Features:
1. Customer Profile:
A customer can sign up by putting their credentials like name, location, e-mail,
phone number. A verification link will be sent via email for verification of that customer.

2. Restaurant Profile:
A restaurant can create their profile using their name, address, e-mail, phone
number, food category. Similar verification process as that of a
customer will be carried out here. After completion of the verification process, the
restaurant will be able to add their photos and information like food name,
price, category, description, spice level to create a menu.
The menu can be updated time-to-time by adding necessary information
about a new food item.

3. Search & Filter:
A user can search and navigate food items and restaurants using the search
box. The website will also give a scope to specify and narrow-down searches
by using various filters like location, price range, food category etc.



4. Ratings & Reviews:
Users can write reviews about any restaurant in general and a particular food
item in the review section of that said restaurant and that particular food item.
They can give ratings by star icons. Every restaurant will show a review count and an
average rating in the form of stars given by users.

5. Recommendations For Customers to Find Restaurants:
By default, our site will show recommendations by showing top-rated restaurants and
individual food items at the top. After succesful creation of a customer profile, that customer will be able to select their
preferred food category so that the website can give recommendations of
restaurants and food items based on that choice.
